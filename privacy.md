# Privacy Policy for Heavy Protocol

**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how Heavy Protocol ("we", "us", or "our") handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
**Heavy Protocol is a local-first application.**
* **Personal Data:** All your body measurements, workout logs, and routine data are stored locally on your device (and in your personal iCloud if you have enabled iCloud Backup).
* **No External Servers:** We do not operate a backend server. We do not transmit your workout data to any third-party cloud service. We cannot see, access, or sell your data.

## 2. HealthKit Integration
Heavy Protocol integrates with Apple’s HealthKit to sync your workout data (e.g., body weight, calories burned, workout duration).
* **Reading Data:** We read body weight data to visualize your progress charts.
* **Writing Data:** We write completed workouts to the Health app so they contribute to your activity rings.
* **Privacy:** This data is never used for marketing or shared with third parties. It stays within the Apple Health ecosystem on your device.

## 3. Analytics
The app does not use third-party analytics SDKs (like Google Analytics or Mixpanel). Any crash reports or usage metrics are provided solely through Apple’s opt-in "Share with App Developers" feature, which is anonymized.
