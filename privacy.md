# Privacy Policy for Heavy Protocol

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how Heavy Protocol ("we", "us", or "our") handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
**Heavy Protocol is a local-first application.**
* **Personal Data:** All your body measurements, workout logs, and routine data are stored locally on your device.
**Backup:** Data may be backed up to your personal cloud storage (e.g., iCloud or Google Drive) if you have enabled device backups.
* **No External Servers:** We do not operate a backend server. We do not transmit your workout data to any third-party cloud service. We cannot see, access, or sell your data.

## 2. Health App Integration
Heavy Protocol integrates with platform health services (**Apple HealthKit** on iOS and **Health Connect** on Android) to sync your workout data.
* **Reading Data:** We read body weight data to visualize your progress charts.
* **Writing Data:** We write completed workouts to your health app so they contribute to your activity goals.
* **Privacy:** This data is never used for marketing or shared with third parties. It stays within the ecosystem of your device.

## 3. Analytics
The app does not use third-party analytics SDKs. Any crash reports or usage metrics are provided solely through platform-standard tools (Apple’s "Share with App Developers" or Google Play Console), which are anonymized.
